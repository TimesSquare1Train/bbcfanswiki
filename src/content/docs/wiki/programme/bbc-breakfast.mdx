## Pre-*Breakfast* era

In 1983, all you heard at 7am on the TV was static. Until the 17th of January when the BBC launched *Breakfast Time*. [Frank Bough](../presenter/frank-bough), [Nick Ross](../presenter/nick-ross), and [Selina Scott](../presenter/selina-scott) hosted that first programme with *[Ron Neil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Neil)* as producer.

Ron then left the programme, and in November of 1986, a more formal format was adopted which included a shortned broadcast, a desk, and suits. Some presenters included [Kirsty Wark](../presenter/kirsty-wark), [John Stapleton](../presenter/john-stapleton), [Sally Magnusson](../presenter/sally-magnusson), and [Jeremy Paxman](../presenter/jeremy-paxman).

Early into the October of 1989, *Breakfast Time* was rebranded to *BBC Breakfast News*. The set caused some issues for the launch of the breakfast news as the show was originally going to launch in September. This version was hosted by [Jill Dando]() and [Nicholas Witchell]().

In 1993, business news in the morning became a thing when "Business Breakfast" launched. It took over the 6:00 hour, therefore moving the breakfast news to start at 7:00 instead of its 1989 time of 6:30.

Both programmes then moved in April 1993, to studio N2 of BBC Television Centre, the home of the BBC's [Nine](), [Six](), and [One O'Clock]() news bulletins.

The programme got it's last name before what whe know it as today in June of 1997 when it was renamed to *Breakfast News*

## The *Breakfast* era

In early October of 2000, two shows from [BBC News 24]() and [BBC One]() became one. It was simply known as *Breakfast* and it's first programme was hosted by [Sophie Raworth]() and [Jeremy Bowen]().
