Below is a suggested set of rules to follow when editing this wiki. Administrators of this wiki should read these rules and adapt them as necessary.

1. **Keep it civil:** Do not make personal attacks on other people. If you need to criticize another user’s argument, do so without attacking them as a person. Do not use bigoted language, including slurs which degrade another person or group of people based on gender, race, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, etc.
2. **Be a productive member of the wiki:** Contribute to the wiki in line with the established processes and conventions. Need help? Ask an administrator! Disrupting the wiki with “edit warring” over differing opinions of a topic with another user or group of users is not productive.
3. **Do not engage in excessive self-promotion:** The wiki is a collaborative community resource for the topic at hand. It is NOT a free place to advertise your related website, YouTube channel, blog, social media account, etc. Have a question about whether your link would be welcome? Ask an administrator!
4. **Do not harass other users:** If somebody asks you to stop posting certain content on their wall, respect their wishes. It is their wall.
5. **Do follow community guidelines for formatting:** When a community has established formatting, it’s important to adhere to that, especially when spoiler content is involved.
